### Georgia Institute of Technology: Human Computer Interaction

## Project: Redesign an Interface that has difficulties in Usability

# Gmail App Redesign (Prototyping, Wireframe)

## Objective
To redesign an interface that can improve human computer interactions.
Take a heuristic evaluation on the interface and find out what works well and what does not work well.
Based on the result of the heuristic evaluation, redesign the interface using one of prototyping tool. 
Develop an evaluation plan for the redesigned interface.

## Requirements
- Adobe XD

## Heuristic Evaluation
1. What works well
  * The application’s overall structure and icons are consistent with ones of its web version
  * The "Undo" pop up gives good tolerance to the interface because users can accidentally delete or move their e-mails and do not even recognize what happens to the emails that the users could not read.
  * The interface shows simplicity in its structure and date information
  * With simplicity, the interface allows users to read and click e-mails with comfort

2. What does not work well
  * Selecting emails one by one cannot be done with ease especially when the users try to sort email inbox that unexpectedly large amounts of emails and spams are pile up
  * Help menu does not provide good documentation
  * When users search for emails with keywords, the application does not provide enough perceptibility because sometimes unexpected emails are searched

## Result (Redesigned Interface)
https://xd.adobe.com/view/9392a3ea-3254-49c4-5ada-95600d322b1c-e5a3/
* Justifications:
  * Better Ease, Consistency, and Flexibility
  * Better Perceptibility

## Further development
Here is a development plan for the next stage of prototyping

1. Take a qualitative evaluation with questions
    1. How many days do you check emails in a week?
    2. Do you prefer to sort emails in mobile? Or PC?
    3. Do you think drag feature to select multiple emails will help you sot emails?
    4. If you chose “No” in Question 3, please explain why
    5. Does “Select All” button distract using the app?
    6. If you chose “Yes” in Question 5, Please explain why
    7. Do you think showing the number of emails found gives you better perceptibility of searching?
    8. If you chose “No” in Question 7, please explain why
    9. Do you think the search keyword feature that allows you to play with the list of emails gives you better understanding and use on email searching?
    10. If you chose “No” in Question 9, please explain why.
2. Consider how to limit biases
